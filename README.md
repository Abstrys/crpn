# crpn - A simple command-line calculator

This is a simple reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator for the command-line.

It's essentially a rewrite of my desktop calculator, [NeRPN](https://github.com/Abstrys/NeRPN),
which is still a neat example of a Swing Java application. 

This version is written in Python and should run just about anywhere.

## How to use it

Install from source:

    cd crpn
    python -m pep517.build .
    pip install dist/crpn-0.0.1.tar.gz
