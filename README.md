# crpn - A simple command-line calculator

This is a simple reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator for the command-line.

It's essentially a rewrite of my desktop calculator, [NeRPN](https://github.com/Abstrys/NeRPN),
which is still a neat example of a Swing Java application. 

This version is written in Python and should run just about anywhere.

## How to use it

For now, just run the `crpn.py` file or throw it in your `$HOME/bin` directory and alias it or
rename it to `crpn`.
